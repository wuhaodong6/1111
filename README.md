computer：
A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.
computer science:
Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.
software:
Computer software, or simply software, is a part of a computer system that consists of data or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.
software engineering:
software engineering (SWE) is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.
Alan Turing:
Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.
Moore's law:
Moore's law (/mɔərz.ˈlɔː/) is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the

1)Information 
Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts.[
2)Positional notation 
Positional notation or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers.
3)Algorithm 
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ al-gə-ri-dhəm) is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.
4)Software bug
A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.
